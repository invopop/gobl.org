		<h2>
			Staggering amounts of time are wasted dealing with inefficient paper documents and archaic electronic formats.

		<div class="columns">
			<p>
				Businesses have to manually extract data from paper receipts and PDFs which don't contain structured data.
			</p>
			<p>
				Standards like XML and Text formats don't reflect the way our programming languages store or transfer data.
			</p>

				It's hard to understand the rules, types of taxes, and general formats required in any given market.

			<mark>

		<h2>
			Businesses waste staggering amounts of time dealing with inefficient paper documents and complex electronic formats.
		</h2>

		<div class="columns">
			<p>
				Accountants have to manually extract data from paper receipts and PDFs which don't contain structured data.
			</p>
			<p>
				Standards built with XML and text formats don't reflect the way our programming languages store or transfer data.
			</p>
			<p>
				It's hard to understand the rules, types of taxes, and general formats required in any given market.
			</p>
		</div>

		<p>
			Dealing with this on a global scale is
			<mark>
				horrendous!

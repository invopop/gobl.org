## What is an invoice?

Before getting started with this essay, let's make sure we're on the same page about electronic invoicing (e-invoicing) and what exactly it means and implies.

An invoice is a kind of legal contract sent from a supplier to a customer that informs them of the sale of goods or services for which they must now pay. The concept is often confused with sale receipts, especially in the United States, as they're very similar in content. In jurisdictions that apply Value Added Tax to sales, an invoice is a legally binding document that must either be adhered to or annulled with another document, like a credit note. A sales receipt by contrast simply represents a transaction that has already happened and doesn't normally imply a contractual agreement.

Traditionally invoices were and indeed still are issued on paper. In the last few decades companies have started switching to sending PDF invoices via email with significant bookkeeping time savings. They're not perfect however, they're still effectively paper-like so its not normally possible to automatically extract data without OCR or AI.

While a PDF is an electronic format, it is not considered an electronic invoice. The key difference is in the structured contents. A true electronic invoice can be read by a machine that can automatically extract the data with 100% accuracy.

## What are the benefits of e-invoicing?

Automation. Incalculable hours are spent by company administrators and book keeping teams manually receiving, forwarding, reading, validating, and extracting data from invoices and introducing the key details by hand into their accounting software. Its a tremendous waste of time.

In an ideal world we'd be able to send an e-invoice to our customers and the only thing they need to do is approve and pay automatically.

The promise of electronic business documents for companies is just that, to dramatically reduce the time wasted paper-pushing, or perhaps more accurately, PDF-pushing.

Increasingly governments around the world are starting to see the benefits of e-invoicing as a means to prevent tax fraud and have much greater visibility over business transactions.

Pioneering tax agencies like the [SAT](https://www.sat.gob.mx/home) in Mexico launched their CFDI format back in 2004, and since 2012 have required all B2B transactions to be backed by e-invoices.
